## Split Data Download
This section of code is used to download the testing and training dataset from Google Drive, that was created in 02-Test and Training Generation. This is so that you do not have to spend hours trying to run the code. 

```{r}
if (!require("googledrive")) install.packages("googledrive")
library("googledrive")
```


```{r}
drive_deauth()
drive_download(as_id("1KIerVlvFELtugrd2vdCUbC6FQHwgNefF"), path = "../data/processed/kddcup_split.csv", overwrite = TRUE)
```
