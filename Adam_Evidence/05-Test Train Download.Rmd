## Test Train Download
This section of code is used to download the split dataset from Google Drive, that was created in 04-Test and Training Generation pt2. This is so that you do not have to run the code. 

```{r}
if (!require("googledrive")) install.packages("googledrive")
library("googledrive")
```


```{r}
drive_deauth()
drive_download(as_id("1BOahFx6tL9FbXN5A4oxMO4KpL99AqdRS"), path = "../data/processed/test_train.csv", overwrite = TRUE)
```
