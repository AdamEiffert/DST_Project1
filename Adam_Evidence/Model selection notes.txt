stability measures are not the most important here because we are looking for an algorithm that does well with very unknown data and so there is likely going to be a fair level of variation from the measured data. However if you were looking at data that is likely very similar to the measured data then stability is more important.

External cluster validation is important here as we have pre-defined labels (normal and non-normal traffic).

internal cluser validation is not important here as we already know the clusters we need (normal and non-normal)

Relative cluster validation is not important here as it is generally used for determining the optimal number of clusters
