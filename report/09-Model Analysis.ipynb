    "\n",
    "The performance of each model varied quite significantly across the four test classes. The Support Vector Machine gave extremely good results on exactly class 4, decent results on class 2 (the main issue was that getting high precision required that recall be quite mediocre), poor results on class 3 and totally useless results on class 1, while the Isolation Forest (and its Extended version) gave excellent results on class 1, good results on class 4 and mostly useless results on classes 2 and 3 (the extended version performed significantly better on these classes, but still not *well* by any means).\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that these two models can both be applied to this problem with good results in some situations, but neither of them is suitable as a sole solution as they will miss certain types of attack."
